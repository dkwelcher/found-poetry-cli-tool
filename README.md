# Found Poetry CLI Tool

The Found Poetry CLI Tool allows the user to submit one or more Word documents and select options for randomizing sentences or specified parts-of-speech patterns.

This project is functional and is currently being refactored. README.md will be updated with more specific details and instructions on how to use the tool soon.
